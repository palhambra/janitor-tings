# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

This challenge is to refactor a given starter code. There were many repeats in the CSS style sheet, which has been condensed to provide a cleaner looking sheet. There were also many "div" elements within the page, which we had to change to semantic HTML to help define the purpose of the content. Alternative text has also been added to the images to help users with disabilities.
